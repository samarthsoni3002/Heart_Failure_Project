# Heart_Failure_Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure in individuals based on various clinical and demographic features.
Heart failure is a critical medical condition, and early prediction can help healthcare professionals take proactive measures to manage and treat patients effectively. 

## Data
The heart failure prediction model is built using a dataset that includes various patient attributes, including age, gender, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and more. 
The dataset used in this project is available in the "HF_Model_Data.csv" file.

## Usage
This repository provides a step-by-step guide of how we worked during our internship.
